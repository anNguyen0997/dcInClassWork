        <p style="font-size:140%">My Name is <b>An Nguyen</b> and while road tripping though the west coast, 
            my family and I stopped by <i><a href="https://visitinglaketahoe.com/">Lake Tahoe</a></i>. It is a beautiful
            lake near the border of <i><a href="https://www.visitcalifornia.com/">California</a></i> and 
            <i><a href="https://travelnevada.com/">Nevada</a></i>. The water is as blue as the sky,
            the trees were tall, green, and surrounded the lake, and sand was dry and warm. 
            The view from the <i>Lake Tahoe</i> beach was incredible. On the horizon, you can see 
            there are mountain ranges covered in snow, forests covered the lake's perimeter, 
            all while being on the beach. I was extremely lucky and grateful to have seen 
            such a sight.
